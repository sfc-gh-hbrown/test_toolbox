description: This project is focused on optimizing data processing and task management
  in Snowflake by implementing several solutions using Streamlit notebooks. It includes
  applications for migrating underutilized tasks to serverless options, enabling the
  Query Acceleration Service (QAS) to improve warehouse performance by managing resource-intensive
  queries, and replacing repetitive CTAS and INSERT OVERWRITE commands with Dynamic
  Tables for efficient automation. Additionally, it provides functionality to convert
  eligible tasks into Dynamic Tables, allowing for more streamlined and automated
  data transformations, while ensuring prerequisites such as role-based access and
  permissions are met for effective execution.
