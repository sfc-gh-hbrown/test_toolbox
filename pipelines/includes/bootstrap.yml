## This is the "bootstrap" file for the solution. It is used to set up the
## pipeline jobs and configuration. It is included in the full-ci.yml file.

## Find the base_bootstrap file in the Snowflake Reference Project:
## https://app.dataops.live/snowflake/shared/snowflake-reference-project/-/blob/main/pipelines/includes/base_bootstrap.yml
include:
  ## Bootstrap in turn from the main DataOps Reference Project
  - project: reference-template-projects/dataops-template/dataops-reference
    ref: 5-stable
    file: /pipelines/includes/base_bootstrap.yml

  ## Snowflake shared variable definitions and overrides

    file: /pipelines/includes/config/variables.yml

  ## Partial of a job to set the tag used to identify the
  ## "agent" that will run the jobs in your pipeline.
  ## We set this here instead of the project level so that
  ## all projects use the same tag and can be switched between
  ## agents easily.

  ## Job to initialise the pipeline (applies to all Snowflake project
  ## pipelines so that's why it's here in the bootstrap!)
